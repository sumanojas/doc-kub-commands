
=>what is pod ?
-pod is a atomic unit of scheduling
-pod are basic unit of scheduling in kubernetes.
-pod is run time environment for kubernetes.

=>multi-container ?
-The primary purpose of a multi-container Pod is to support co-located, co-managed helper processes for a main program. 
 There are some general patterns of using helper processes in Pods:
-Sidecar containers "help" the main container. For example, log or data change watchers, monitoring adapters, and so on.
 A log watcher, for example, can be built once by a different team and reused across different applications. 
 Another example of a sidecar container is a file or data loader that generates data for the main container.

=>pod networking ?
-The Pods are groups of containers that share networking and storage resources from the same node. They are created with an API server and placed by a controller. 
 Each Pod is assigned an IP address, and all the containers in the Pod share the same storage, IP address, and port space (network namespace).
