=>what is prometheus ?
:promethus is a time series database.
 prometheus is designed to monitor targets.
 servers, databases, standalone virtual machines,pretty much everything can be monitored with prometheus.
:you can also monitor your application's or docker host and kubernetes cluster by using prometheus easily.

when does it fit?
-purely numeric time series.
-it fits both machine-centric monitoring and highly dynamic service-oriented architectures.
-prometheous is designed for reliability, during an system outage it allow you to quickly diagnose problems.
-each prometheus server is standalone, does not depend on any n/w storage or other remote services.

when does it not fit?
-if you need 100% accuracy, such as for per-request billing, prometheus is not a good choice
