1. Any 3 best practices of docker?

=>  -always keep Dockerfile in empty directory or make sure directory where Dockerfile present with required files
    -use official images when possible
    -use more specific tags
      the "latest" tag is a rolling tag. be specific, to prevent unexpected changes in your base image.
    -look for minimal flavors
      just using a different base image reduced the image size by 540MB
    -Multi-stage builds to remove build deps

2. Difference between docker stop and docker kill?

=>  docker stop:
    . stop a running container(send SIGTERM, and then SIGKILL after grace period)
    . the main process inside the container will receive SIGTERM, and after a grace period, SIGKILL.

    docker kill:
    . kill a running container (send SIGKILL, or specified signal)
    . the main process inside the contianer will be sent SIGKILL, or any signal specified with option --signal.

3. Command to list containers which state is exited?

=>  -docker ps -a -f status=running
    -docker ps -a -f status=exited
    -docker ps -a -f status=created
    -docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)

4. command to clean-up docker host ( deleting stopped conatiners, dangling images and unused networks)?

=>  -docker system prune

5. What version of docker you have used? Specific reason to use that particular version?

=>  

6. Can we have multiple CMD in Dockerfile?

=>  - we can have it but no use like when you have multiple cmds only the last cmd will be taken into account.
      so multiple cmds if you have it's no use only last cmd it's going to take.

7. Have you worked on docker swarm and docker compose?

=>  - Docker swarm:-
    . A docker swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the docker application and that have been configured to join together in a cluster.
    . Docker swarm is a container orchestration tool, meaning that it allows the user to manage multiple containers deployed across multiple host machines.

    - Docker compose:-
    . Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
    . with compose, you use a yaml file to configure your application's services.

8. Have you worked on multi-stage dockerfile and why we need that?

=> With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build.
   You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another

9. Lets say i have container which is attached with a volume, if container crashes what happens to volume?

=>  -sudo docker run -it --name my-volume-test -v data-volume:/data busybox /bin/sh
    volume won't be deleted.
    -docker volume ls

10. can you copy a file from local to run container?

=>  yes
  docker cp <filename> <container-id:/>
you can check 
 docker exec -it <container-id> /bin/sh 

11. Lets say I have 1 GB file that has to be sent to docker daemon, as its 1GB it will take muchtime and network too.
    By which option while building dockerfile we can send the fileIn better manner?

=>  docker build --compress .

12. What is the difference between ADD and COPY docker instructions in Dockerfile?

=>  COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. They let you copy files from a specific location into a Docker image.
    COPY takes in a src and destination. ... A valid use case for ADD is when you want to extract a local tar file into a specific directory in your Docker image.

13. Command to remove to stopped and running Containers?

=>
docker ps -aq
docker stop $(docker ps -qa)
docker rm $(docker stop $(docker ps -qa))
  
14. Inside the container I did many changes like  Creating, modifying and deleting file but I Wanted to check which files has been changed And
    what action has been taken what is the  Command we need to use ?

=>
docker diff <container-id>

15. What does ONBUILD instruction do in Dockerfile?

16. What is the use of .dockerignore file?

17. I have dockerfile that accepts arguments, if I supply value as “1” then it should use maven 2.x version for base image and if I supply “2” then it should take maven latest as base image 

18. What are docker compose and docker swarm?
