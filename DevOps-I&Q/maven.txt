=> build lifecycle basics
   - there are three built-in build lifecycles: default, clean and site.
    . the default lifecycle handles your project deployment.
    . the clean lifecycle handles project cleaning.
    . while the sites lifecycle handles the creation of your project's site documentation.

   - phases of default lifecycle
    . validate- validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
    . compile- compile the source code of the project.
    . test- test the compiles source code using a suitable unit testing framework. these tests should not require the code be packages or deployed.
    . package- take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
    . verify- run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
    . install- install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
    . deploy- done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

2. what are the settings you need to do before running mvn deploy?

3. why maven takes much time for 1st execution and from 2nd execution it will take less time?

=> -while executing first it will check in the local repository if that dependency is there in local repository so then it will fetch it from here
    if it doen't exist then it will go to central repository and then it will fetch it.
    so that's why when you execute for the first time it will take much time so when you execute for the second time 
    so already all dependencies will be downloaded so that's the reason it will take very less time.

4. what is multi module project in maven and what are the setting you want to do in multi module parent and child project? what is dependency management?

   If yes, how would you do that?

=> mvn install -Dmaven.repo.local=/alternate/repo/location 

7. maven follows convention over configuration that means it assumes code should be there under src/main/java, test cases under src/tests and many more.
   Here my requirement is I donâ€™t want to follow that conventions I need to use different folder structure is that possible in maven?
