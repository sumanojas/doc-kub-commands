-------------------------------------------------------Ansible--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Why we need ad-hoc ansible commands, scenario where you have used ansible ad-hoc command?
=>  -An ansible ad-hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes.
     Ad-hoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not reusable.
    Ex:-
    - ansible all -i '146.148.67.44,' -m ping
    - ansible dev -i hosts -m ping
    - ansible dev -i hosts -m setup
    - ansible dev -i hosts -m copy -a 'src=/home/deekshithsn2/hosts dest=/home/deekshithsn2/'

2. When i need detailed logs on executing ansible playbook what option i need to use?
=>  - ansible-playbook -i hosts copy.yml -vvvv

3. what is ansible.cfg file?
=>  - present by default under /etc/ansible
    - you can define certain settings in ansible.cfg
    
4. what are the modules have you worked on? which module will you use for getting the file from node to master?
=>  -copy,fetch,yum,debug,get_url,expect,template,file,apt,command,shell
    -fetch
---
- hosts: dev
  become: yes
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: Install application tree
      fetch:
        src: /home/spovedd/a
        dest: /home/spovedd
# ansible-playbook -i hosts fetch.yml

5. Lets say i have a playbook which has 5 tasks in playbook, first 2 tasks should run on local machine and other 3 tasks should run on node?
=>  
---
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: installing wget 
      apt:
        name: wget
        state: present 
    - name: download Jenkins
      get_url:
        url: https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/war/2.248/jenkins.war
        dest: /home/spovedd
    
- hosts: dev
  become: yes
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: copy jenkins war to host machines
      copy:
        src: /home/spovedd/jenkins.war
        dest: /home/jenkins.war
    - name: creating folder structure and running jenkins in the background 
      shell: |
        mkdir -p /home/spovedd/jenkins
        mv /home/jenkins.war /home/spovedd/jenkins
        nohup java -jar /home/spovedd/jenkins/jenkins.war &

6. Lets say i have 4 machines consider 1 as ansible master other 3 as nodes, what are the basic setup you need to do for ansible cluster?
=>

7. what are ansible roles? why we need ansible roles? have you worked on ansible galaxy?
=>
-roles provide a framework for fully independent, or interdependent collections of variables,tasks,files,templates,and modules.
-in ansible,the role is the primary mechanism for breaking a playbook into multiple files.
 this simplfies writing complex playbooks and it makes them easier to reuse.
-the breaking of playbook allows you to logically break the playbook into reusable components.
-roles are not playbooks.roles are small funtionality which can be independently used but have to be used within playbooks.
-there is no way to directly execute a role. roles have no explicit setting for which host the role will apply to.
-make use of ansible galaxy commands to create folder structure for of roles - httpls://galaxy.ansible.com/
-ansible-galaxy search role_name, ansible-galaxy init role_name, ansible-galaxy inti --force --offline role_name

8. What are ansible facts?
=>
-ansible collects pretty much all the information about the remote hosts as it runs a palybook.
 the task of collecting this remote system information is called as Gathering Facts by ansible
 and the details collected are generally known as facts or variables.

-this informmation can be obtained manually using ansible adhoc command and a specialized module named setup.
 in fact, ansible playbooks call this setup module by default to perform Gathering facts task.
 ansible all -i '<remote-ip>,' -m setup

9. Can we have windows machine as ansible master? as node?have you worked on any windows modules? can you list few?any extra configuration do we need to do?

=> No, you can't have window machine as ansible master. but for node it's possible.

10. Why ansible ? What makes ansible powerful than other tools like chef and puppet?

11. 5 modules that you have worked on? Can we create custom module ?

12. What is dynamic inventory in ansible?

13. Lets say I have both Ubuntu and centos machines as nodes I want install application tree using same playbook, how would you approach this scenario? 

14. How to handle prompts with ansible playbook?

15. what is roles ?

=>In Ansible, the role is the primary mechanism for breaking a playbook into multiple files.
  This simplifies writing complex playbooks, and it makes them easier to reuse.
  The breaking of playbook allows you to logically break the playbook into reusable components.
